<p>One of the reasons I wanted to start learning about coding and software engineering was out of admiration for Satoru Iwata.</p>

<p>In my opinion, his superior skill in programming was matched by his kindness.</p>
<p>Here are some fun facts about Satoru Iwata:</p>

    <b><li>Balloon Fight Influenced Super Mario Bros.</li></b>
    <p></p>

    <p><i>Balloon Fight</i>, which can be seen as a clone of the game <i>Joust</i>, has programming elements that made an impact on future games. One such influence was on <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>; the flying physics in Balloon Fight helped define the physics for the underwater levels.</p>
    <b><li>Two Years or Six Months</li></b>
    <p></p>

    <p>While <i>EarthBound</i> is now considered a cult classic, the development of the game proved difficult. The game was being co-developed by HAL Laboratory where Iwata was CEO. Four years into development, the game was in a state where it might never be completed. When Iwata came in to assist, he made a proposition: they could take two years to fix what was wrong, or they could start over and be done in six months. They started from scratch and were able to complete the game in less than a year.</p>

    <p>Iwata also assisted the company Game Freak with their popular <i>Pokemon</i> series in a number of ways. In addition to localizing <i>Pokemon Red</i> and <i>Pokemon Green</i> for the west, he created graphic compression tools for the sequel games <i>Pokemon Gold</i> and <i>Pokemon Silver</i>. This essentially allowed the original games to be included in the new ones and doubled the amount of content. Additionally, he ported the battle systems from the Game Boy to the Nintendo 64 title <i>Pokemon Stadium</i> by studying the original source code.</p>
