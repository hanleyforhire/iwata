# Web Page - Satoru Iwata
## A repository for a coding assignment through MIT | xPro for their <br> Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN program.

### Goal:
Create a web page using html formatting. The page should include a list, headings, images, and hyperlinks.

### Execution:
For my page I decided to highlight a few aspects about the late Satoru Iwata and his career. Once again this is just a simple page that can be published through GitHub. Everything was formatted in an html text file.
